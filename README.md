 Small-scale oral cancer detection systems aid in early identification but are not a substitute for professional diagnosis. Caution is advised, and regular professional evaluation is necessary for accurate assessment and timely intervention.  
 # Small-Scale Oral Cancer Detection System

## Overview
The Small-Scale Oral Cancer Detection System is a project aimed at leveraging non-invasive methods and specialized devices for the early detection of potential signs of oral cancer. This system incorporates visual inspections, palpation, and screening devices to assist in identifying suspicious lesions in the oral cavity, including the lips, gums, tongue, and cheeks. While the system serves as a valuable screening tool, it is essential to note that it is not a replacement for professional medical diagnosis and treatment.

## Features
- Utilizes non-invasive screening methods
- Incorporates specialized devices for enhanced visibility of suspicious areas
- Helps in raising awareness and promoting regular oral health screenings
- Designed to aid in the early identification of oral cancer for timely intervention
- Can be integrated into routine oral examinations for high-risk individuals

## How It Works
The system involves a comprehensive examination of the oral cavity using visual inspections and palpation to look for abnormalities such as red or white patches, persistent sores, or lumps. Additionally, specialized screening devices like toluidine blue dye or fluorescent lights may be utilized to enhance the visualization of potentially cancerous or precancerous lesions. By incorporating these detection methods into regular oral health screenings, individuals at higher risk, such as tobacco users or those with a family history of oral cancer, can take proactive steps towards monitoring their oral health.

## Caution
While the Small-Scale Oral Cancer Detection System offers valuable support in early cancer identification, users are advised to exercise caution and seek professional medical guidance. A definitive diagnosis of oral cancer typically requires a biopsy and laboratory analysis of suspicious tissue, which should be performed by qualified healthcare professionals. Relying solely on the system for diagnosis and treatment without professional oversight can lead to delays in care and unfavorable outcomes.
